# FIFA-World-Cup-Analysis
This project contains a PostgreSQL-based analysis of FIFA World Cup data from 2002 to 2018. The SQL queries analyze team performance metrics across five World Cup tournaments, answering key questions about participating countries, games played, wins, losses, goals scored, goals conceded, goal differences, and points earned.
